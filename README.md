# IOT Visualization and Advanced Analytics Project
Object of the project is to capture IOT data in a database and visualize it.
## Objective 1
Generate "Fake/Sample" Data
Store the data in a database
## Objective 2
Visualize the data
## Objective 3
use Machine Learning code to test out visualization for predictive analytics

## Data Generation:
Python will be used to generate sample data
## Data Storage
multiple Databases will be used to store the data for testing purpose
A Timeseries database is ideal
## Visualization
Tools such as Grafan, Node.js or other web based technology will be  used
## Machine Learning
Python with tensorflow and other libraries will be used depending on the code
## Included files (In Progress)
mysql_test.py contains code that generates sample data and adds to a mysql table.
schema.sql contains mysql schema and table creation code.
iot_data_elastic_search.py (In Prgress) will contain code to enter random data into ElasticSearch
Note: This is a personal project (Not Forked)
